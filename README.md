# Widdle: Wordle Clone

Widdle is a fun and addictive word puzzle game inspired by the classic game Wordle. Built using React JS (Vite) and Tailwind CSS, this project brings the excitement of guessing a secret word within a limited number of attempts right to your web browser.

## About
I created this app as a personal project to improve my React skills. The app currently uses Context to store all state within the app. I am planning to revisit this project in the future to add animation and switch to Redux for state management.

## Features
üß† Test your word-solving skills: Guess the secret five-letter word within six attempts.
üéÆ User-friendly interface: Intuitive design for a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.
üåà Responsive and stylish: Crafted with Tailwind CSS, Widdle has been created to mimic the Wordle design and be responsive on Web and Mobile.
‚è±Ô∏è Timeless fun: A quick yet engaging game that can be played during short breaks or leisure time.
